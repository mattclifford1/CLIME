TODOS
 - param for weight of LIME balancer
        - not started

 - have Bayes CLF to compare against???

 - situations from mean to boarder -> how does this affect LIME balancer?
        - made graphs, now label them properly and get useful results


 - KL div (fit a Gaussian or other way to compare probabilites?)

 - normalise the datasets (check attributes to see if this is okay to do)

 - Think how to display/illustrate experiments better?
  - single plot for between means?

- pipeline param for eval between means length


--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

BUGS
fix pipeline.get_avg  -> multiple_runs.py


FUTURE
rebalance by under sampling?? (makes different just cost sensitive training)
more ABC for each part of the pipeline (and docs for expected formats)
tests for input error msg in the pipeline


THOUGHTS
 - change lime internals as options rather than fixed methods e.g. can change model, sampling, balancing etc.
