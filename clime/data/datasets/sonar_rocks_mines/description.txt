NAME: Sonar, Mines vs. Rocks

SUMMARY: This is the data set used by Gorman and Sejnowski in their study
of the classification of sonar signals using a neural network [1].  The
task is to train a network to discriminate between sonar signals bounced
off a metal cylinder and those bounced off a roughly cylindrical rock.

SOURCE: The data set was contributed to the benchmark collection by Terry
Sejnowski, now at the Salk Institute and the University of California at
San Deigo.  The data set was developed in collaboration with R. Paul
Gorman of Allied-Signal Aerospace Technology Center.

PROBLEM DESCRIPTION:

The file "sonar.mines" contains 111 patterns obtained by bouncing sonar
signals off a metal cylinder at various angles and under various
conditions.  The file "sonar.rocks" contains 97 patterns obtained from
rocks under similar conditions.  The transmitted sonar signal is a
frequency-modulated chirp, rising in frequency.  The data set contains
signals obtained from a variety of different aspect angles, spanning 90
degrees for the cylinder and 180 degrees for the rock.

Each pattern is a set of 60 numbers in the range 0.0 to 1.0.  Each number
represents the energy within a particular frequency band, integrated over
a certain period of time.  The integration aperture for higher frequencies
occur later in time, since these frequencies are transmitted later during
the chirp.

The label associated with each record contains the letter "R" if the object
is a rock and "M" if it is a mine (metal cylinder).  The numbers in the
labels are in increasing order of aspect angle, but they do not encode the
angle directly.
