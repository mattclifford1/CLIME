Data Set Information:

Predicting the age of abalone from physical measurements. 
The age of abalone is determined by cutting the shell through the cone, 
staining it, and counting the number of rings through a microscope -- 
a boring and time-consuming task. Other measurements, which are easier 
to obtain, are used to predict the age. Further information, such as 
weather patterns and location (hence food availability) may be required 
to solve the problem.

From the original data examples with missing values were removed 
(the majority having the predicted value missing), and the ranges 
of the continuous values have been scaled for use with an ANN (by dividing by 200).

Attribute Information:

Given is the attribute name, attribute type, the measurement unit and 
a brief description. The number of rings is the value to predict: either 
as a continuous value or as a classification problem.

Name / Data Type / Measurement Unit / Description
-----------------------------
Sex / nominal / -- / M, F, and I (infant)
Length / continuous / mm / Longest shell measurement
Diameter / continuous / mm / perpendicular to length
Height / continuous / mm / with meat in shell
Whole weight / continuous / grams / whole abalone
Shucked weight / continuous / grams / weight of meat
Viscera weight / continuous / grams / gut weight (after bleeding)
Shell weight / continuous / grams / after being dried
Rings / integer / -- / +1.5 gives the age in years
