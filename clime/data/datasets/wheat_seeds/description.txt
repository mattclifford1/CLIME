Data Set Information:

The examined group comprised kernels belonging to three different varieties 
of wheat: Kama, Rosa and Canadian, 70 elements each, randomly selected for
the experiment. High quality visualization of the internal kernel structure 
was detected using a soft X-ray technique. It is non-destructive and considerably 
cheaper than other more sophisticated imaging techniques like scanning microscopy 
or laser technology. The images were recorded on 13x18 cm X-ray KODAK plates. 
Studies were conducted using combine harvested wheat grain originating from 
experimental fields, explored at the Institute of Agrophysics of the Polish 
Academy of Sciences in Lublin.

The data set can be used for the tasks of classification and cluster analysis.

Attribute Information:

To construct the data, seven geometric parameters of wheat kernels were measured:
1. area A,
2. perimeter P,
3. compactness C = 4*pi*A/P^2,
4. length of kernel,
5. width of kernel,
6. asymmetry coefficient
7. length of kernel groove.
All of these parameters were real-valued continuous.
